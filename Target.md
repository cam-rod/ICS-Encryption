# Goals

## Requirements

- read from a preset text file
- provide the option to encrypt or decrypt
  - if encrypt, request a password and generate the encryption key
  - [ ] ord() characters and use encryption key to shift letters
  - [ ] save to a new file
  - if decrypt, request a password and generate the encryption key
  - [ ] use encryption key to shift letters and chr() characters
  - [ ] save to a new file

**Additional Goals**

- Use a GUI (probably Tkinter) to [select the input file](https://pythonspot.com/tk-file-dialogs/)
- Use another form of encryption OR add onto the shift encryption (use Checkcryption as inspiration)
